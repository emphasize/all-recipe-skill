pork chops italiano

 Ingredients

        1 teaspoon olive oil
        2 cups sliced mushrooms
        2 tablespoons olive oil
        6 (3/4 inch thick) pork loin chops
        2 cloves garlic, crushed
        1 cup chopped onion
        1 (14.5 ounce) can diced Italian tomatoes, undrained
        1 teaspoon dried basil
        ½ teaspoon dried oregano
        ½ teaspoon salt
        ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
        ½ cup water, if necessary
        1 large green bell pepper, cut in 6 pieces

Directions
        Step 1
       Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in
       mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 7
       minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.
        Step 2
       Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over
       medium heat. Add the pork chops, browning on both sides, 7 to 10
       minutes. Place the pork chops on a plate, then drain all but 1
       tablespoon of drippings from the skillet. Stir in the garlic and
       onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
       translucent, about 5 minutes.
        Step 3
       Pour in the tomatoes, then season with basil, oregano, salt, and
       pepper. Transfer the pork chops back to the skillet; cover and
       simmer until the pork chops are tender and no longer pink in the
       center, about 45 minutes. Stir in some water if the mixture becomes
       too dry. Place the bell pepper on top of the pork, then add the
       reserved mushrooms. Continue to simmer until the bell pepper is
       tender, 5 to 10 minutes.


Cook's Note

   Don't add the green pepper wedges until your chops are done, otherwise,
   they will turn to mush.
