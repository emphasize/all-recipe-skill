 Ingredients


        1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, drained (juice reserved)
        ¼ cup cornstarch
        1 ¾ cups water, divided
        ¾ cup white sugar
        ½ cup distilled white vinegar
        2 drops orange food color
        8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch
       cubes
        2 ¼ cups self-rising flour
        2 tablespoons vegetable oil
        2 tablespoons cornstarch
        ½ teaspoon salt
        ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
        1 egg
        1 ½ cups water
        1 quart vegetable oil for frying
        2 green bell pepper, cut into 1 inch pieces

Directions
        Step 1
       In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups water, sugar, vinegar, reserved
       pineapple juice, and orange food coloring. Heat to boiling. Turn
       off heat. Combine 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; slowly stir
       into saucepan. Continue stirring until mixture thickens.
        Step 2
       Combine flour, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, salt,
       white pepper, and egg. Add 1 1/2 cups water gradually to make a
       thick batter. Stir to blend thoroughly. Add chicken pieces, and
       stir until chicken is well coated.
        Step 3
       Heat oil in skillet or wok to 360 degrees Fahrenheit  (180 degrees Celsius ). Fry
       chicken pieces in hot oil 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove
       chicken, and drain on paper towels.
        Step 4
       When ready to serve, layer green peppers, pineapple chunks, and
       cooked chicken pieces on a platter. Pour hot sweet and sour sauce
       over top.


Editor's Note

   We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a
   retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary
   depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the
   specific type of oil used.
